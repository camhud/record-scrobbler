# record-scrobbler
Scrobbles records from discogs collection to last.fm

# project description
Record scrobbler adds all releases in a discogs collection to a GUI menu, and links the collection to a last.fm account. To scrobble, a record may be selected from the list. Options for scrobbling include the entire record, just the a-side, just the b-side, or tracks of the user's choosing. It then pushes the scrobbles to the linked last.fm account. The collection is automatically updated each time record scrobbler is opened.

# ideas
* sort collection by album or artist
* change collection view (list, album cover tiles)
* see information about discogs release
* select favorite albums so as to be more easily accessible
* search collection for a certain release
* select random item from collection
* store recently played records in a list
* list of most played records
* list of stats (total time scrobbled, etc.)
* user can select "about to play" or "just played"
* now playing page, if user selects "about to play", will grab track length 
  info and display current track, album, artist, along with album artwork
* manually update discogs collection
* cache scrobbles when offline
* manually set album cover
